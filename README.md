Bought on ebay without software and not find it anywhere I wrote this little program in c and assembly to use it.
Deprommer is little more than a proof of concept, it allows you to read, program and verify eprom types 2764, 27c128, 27c256 27c512.
I anticipate that it probably doesn't work very well on all eproms, it should be completed with the addition of variants that differ by manufacturer.
